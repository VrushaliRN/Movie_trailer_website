Udacity Project 1: Movie Trailer Website - using Python
How Did I complete this project?
This project is connected to the Programming Foundations with Python course. Here's what I did:

1. Install Python
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
4. To generate a website that displays these movies, here it's provided a starter code repository that contains a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. To get started, fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub. Then clone your ud036_StarterCode repository to work on this project locally on your computer. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.
Ensure that website renders correctly when made an attempt to load it in a browser.

Notes:
1. The file fresh_tomatoes.py contains the open_movies_page() function that will take in my list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase my favorite movies.
2. the task is to write a movie class in media.py. To do this, think about what the properties of a movie are that need to be encapsulated in a movie object such as movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. Look at what open_movies_page() does with a list of movie objects for hints on how to design movie class.
3. write a constructor for the movie class so that you can create instances of movie.
4. create a list of these movie objects in entertainment_center.py by calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects. 
5. Iâ€™ve given movies their own custom data structure by defining the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure. 
6. This list of movies is what the open_movies_page() function needs as input in order to build the HTML file, so I can display my website.


Movie-Trailer-Website

This project will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. 
The code stores a list of movie titles, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. 
This information is displayed on a web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.

This Movie Trailer Website is my project 2 which consists of 3 Python version 2.7.9 files that store a list of movies titles, 
along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. 

The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, 
box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent your favorite movies and 
groups all the instances together in a list.

The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, 
which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
